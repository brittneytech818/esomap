## Quick Walkthrough

1. Speak with [拉祖姆达](/npc/razum_dar "拉祖姆达 (Razum-dar)"), then talk to
   [指挥官卡莉妮斯](/npc/commander_karinith "指挥官卡莉妮斯 (Commander Karinith)") and [伊尔希尔](/npc/ealcil "伊尔希尔 (Ealcil)")。
2. Complete [随波逐流](/quest/cast_adrift "随波逐流 (Cast Adrift)") and
   [双月之泪](/quest/tears_of_the_two_moons "双月之泪 (Tears of the Two Moons)")。
3. Find Razum-dar in [米斯特拉尔](/location/mistral "米斯特拉尔 (Mistral)")。

## Detailed Walkthrough

[拉祖姆达](/npc/razum_dar "拉祖姆达 (Razum-dar)") will be waiting for you outside the
[破败塔楼](/location/ruined_tower "破败塔楼 (Ruined Tower)") you awoke in. He will say that you must become more familiar so
your presence won't be suspect. Apparently you fell from the sky, and while before he wasn't sure how you would fit into
his mission, he has now decided you may be of help. He will urge you to keep your arrival a secret by claiming to be
just another soldier. Then, he will have you speak to [指挥官卡莉妮斯](/npc/commander_karinith "指挥官卡莉妮斯 (Commander Karinith)"),
who will then send you to speak with [伊尔希尔](/npc/ealcil "伊尔希尔 (Ealcil)"). Karinith needs you to help search for
survivors of the storm in the [破碎浅滩](/location/shattered_shoals "破碎浅滩 (Shattered Shoals)") area to the west. Ealcil, on
the other hand, is a scholar who has just returned from a
[神殿](/location/temple "哀悼之泉神殿 (Temple of the Mourning Springs)") with a mysterious rock that produces endless water. He
was attacked by skeletons and barely escaped with his life and the stone, leaving behind the rest of the expedition.

Follow Razum-dar back to the north exit. He will suggest that you to help one or both of them in order to obtain the
trust of the locals, then meet him in [米斯特拉尔](/location/mistral "米斯特拉尔 (Mistral)"), a port city to the north. You will
need to complete the two objectives and the quests they lead to ([随波逐流](/quest/cast_adrift "随波逐流 (Cast Adrift)") and
[双月之泪](/quest/tears_of_the_two_moons "双月之泪 (Tears of the Two Moons)")) to complete this quest. Once you have done so,
head to Mistral. When you arrive, Razum-dar will be on the north end of the long bridge leading into the city.

### Alternate Start

If you leave Khenarthi's Roost before starting this quest, you will be able to acquire it from
[崔莫勒船长](/npc/captain_tremouille "崔莫勒船长 (Captain Tremouille)") in
[弗克赫尔守卫](/location/vulkhel_guard "弗克赫尔守卫 (Vulkhel Guard)"). He is standing on the deck of the ship you wake up in; you
can't miss him. He'll say you slept all the way from [柯娜西的居所](/location/khenarthi_s_roost "柯娜西的居所 (Khenarthi's Roost)"),
right through a hurricane. A [虎人](/wiki/Online:Khajiit "虎人 (Khajiit)")已呼唤[拉祖姆达](/npc/razum_dar "拉祖姆达 (Razum-dar)")
fished you out of the ocean and paid for your passage, then went to
[鹰栖崖堡](/location/eagle_s_strand "鹰栖崖堡 (Eagle's Strand)"), an old fort on the island. If you want to go back to
Khenarthi's Roost, he says to find a boatswain called [甜爪子](/npc/sugar_claws "甜爪子 (Sugar-Claws)"). She is on the eastern
side of the docks. At first, she'll think that you're there about some worrying business with fish, but she offers to
take you to Khenarthi's Roost for free.

Once there, you will be on the shore, facing the south entrance to Eagle's Strand. Head on in, and Razum-dar will
approach you.

## 笔记

- If you leave Eagle's Strand before speaking to both Commander Karinith, Ealcil, and meeting Razum-dar at the statues,
  then you will fail the current objective and be told to find Razum-dar back in the camp. There will be a
  [字条](/book/note "拉祖姆达的字条 (Note from Razum-dar)") from him there, giving you the quest's objectives (Shattered Shoals
  and Temple of the Mourning Springs) and telling you to meet him in Mistral.
- If you complete Cast Adrift or Tears of the Two Moons without starting this quest, [扎里](/npc/zaeri "扎里 (Zaeri)") will
  appear at those locations once the quest is complete to direct you to the other objective.
- If you bypass everything including Eagle's Strand, Shattered Shoals, and the Temple of the Mourning Springs, there is
  a notice at the [新月神殿](/location/temple_of_the_crescent_moons "新月神殿 (Temple of the Crescent Moons)") and a note
  outside Silat's House at [捕风种植园](/location/windcatcher_plantation "捕风种植园 (Windcatcher Plantation)") entitled
  [致我来自海滩的朋友](/book/to_my_friend_from_the_beach "致我来自海滩的朋友 (To My Friend From the Beach)"). Engaging in a dialogue with
  this notice starts the quest.
- If you head straight to Mistral, you are able to start
  [外交风险](/quest/the_perils_of_diplomacy "外交风险 (The Perils of Diplomacy)") without completing this quest.
- Between the release of [One Tamriel](/wiki/Online:One_Tamriel "One Tamriel") and the release of
  _[晨风](/wiki/Online:Morrowind "晨风 (Morrowind)")_, Captain Tremouille was not available as a quest giver, as all Aldmeri
  Dominion characters started directly on Khenarthi's Roost upon finishing the
  [冷港的丧魂傀儡](/quest/soul_shriven_in_coldharbour "冷港的丧魂傀儡 (Soul Shriven in Coldharbour)") tutorial quest.
- Prior to Update 10, you were dropped into Vulkhel Guard upon leaving Coldharbour, and Captain Tremouille was the
  primary starting point for the quest. During this time, the objectives to complete the quests at Shattered Shoals and
  the Temple of the Mourning Springs were optional.

笔记

\* Any text displayed in angle brackets (e.g., `<Alias=LocationHold>`) is dynamically set by the game and will be filled
in with the appropriate word(s) when seen in game.

- Not all Journal Entries may appear in your journal; which entries appear and which entries do not depends on the
  manner in which the quest is done.
- Stages are not always in order of progress. This is usually the case with quests that have multiple possible outcomes
  or quests where certain tasks may be done in any order. Some stages may therefore repeat objectives seen in other
  stages.
