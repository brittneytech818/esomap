## Detailed Walkthrough

### A Hooded Figure

When you first arrive in a major city, you will be approached by a hooded figure, who'll ask to speak to you. If you
don't talk to her when she approaches you there, you can find her fixing a wagon in the city later on. Either way,
you'll need to speak with her.

-
  - _"Greetings. My [benefactor](/wiki/Online:The_Benefactor "恩人") wishes to speak to you about a matter that could
    affect the fate of our world."_
  - **你的恩人想要什么？**
  - _"如果我的恩人想公开讨论细节，那为什么要派信使来呢？这件事只让你知道。"_
  - **那好吧。**
  - _"我的恩人就在附近等我，不要耽搁了。"_
  - **我这就出发。**

  gate of [达文卫城](/wiki/Online:Davon%27s_Watch "达文卫城")。

Inside, you'll find the [benefactor](/wiki/Online:The_Benefactor "恩人"). However, they're incapacitated, and unable to
speak. A trio of [Worm Cultists](/wiki/Online:Worm_Cultist_(Main_Quest) "Worm Cultist (Main Quest)") will appear,
initiating a cutscene that culminates in your murder at the hands of [曼尼玛克](/wiki/Online:Mannimarco "曼尼玛克"), and your
consignment to the Wailing Prison in [冷港](/wiki/Online:Coldharbour "冷港")。

[![](//images.uesp.net/thumb/f/fc/ON-place-The_Wailing_Prison.jpg)](/wiki/File:ON-place-The_Wailing_Prison.jpg)

[](/wiki/File:ON-place-The_Wailing_Prison.jpg "Enlarge")

The cell you're stuck in

### 越狱

You find yourself locked in a cave-like cell littered with bones, located deep within the bowels of Coldharbour. As you
approach the door, Lyris Titanborn will approach.

-
  - **丽里丝·泰坦伯恩:** _"Whoa there! Are you alright?"_
  - **丽里丝·泰坦伯恩:** _"我叫丽里丝。"_
  - **丽里丝·泰坦伯恩:** _"我希望你还保有斗志。你会需要的。"_

Exit the cell and follow Lyris over to the body of a [低等魔人](/wiki/Online:Dremora_Churl "低等魔人"). If you're playing
through the quest as the tutorial, she'll instruct you to pick up its
[Cast-Off Iron Greatsword](//esoitem.uesp.net/itemLink.php?&itemid=42411&level=1&quality=1). Once you have done so,
follow Lyris down the passageway. As you continue through the dark tunnels, another Dremora Churl appears. If you're
playing through this quest as a tutorial, it freezes the action to guide you though attacking the enemy. Otherwise,
you're free to kill it on your own. Once it is defeated, continue to follow Lyris into a larger room. Three
[丧魂傀儡](/wiki/Online:Soul_Shriven "丧魂傀儡") prisoners are trying to keep a door closed, while something large pummels it
from the other side. One of them, an [亚龙人](/wiki/Online:Argonian "亚龙人") named [厄·杰森](/wiki/Online:Er-Jaseen "厄·杰森"),
calls out as you approach to keep going.

Lyris will agree, and move on. As you enter a room filled with a number of torture cages, a
[魔人上民](/wiki/Online:Dremora_Kynval "魔人上民") appears. The tutorial guides you through blocking an enemy's heavy attack,
indicated by the yellow starburst around the enemy, and exploiting the resulting effect of them being knocked off
balance using a heavy attack yourself. Afterwards, you are immediately confronted by a
[魔人火法师](/wiki/Online:Dremora_Kyngald "魔人火法师"), who begins to cast a spell. Here, you are introduced to interrupting a
special attack, indicated by the red starburst. Once again, you can exploit while the enemy is disoriented. A
disoriented or off-balance enemy is indicated by the swirling circle around their head.

Defeat the enemies, and follow Lyris. As you approach the door, a glowing rune appears before you and a ghostly figure
known as [先知](/wiki/Online:The_Prophet "先知") appears.

-
  - **丽里丝·泰坦伯恩:** _"先知！"_
  - **先知:** _"你好，弥留之魂。就像你一样，我也是一名被困此地的囚犯。"_
  - **先知:** _"你一定要救我。而我，作为回报，一定会救你。"_
  - **丽里丝·泰坦伯恩:** _"等等。过来，我们得谈谈。"_

Talk to Lyris. She says that the person who just spoke to you is also being held prisoner, and that if either of you
have a chance of leaving Coldharbour, you'll need to break him out. Lyris says that you'll need to distract Molag Bal by
breaking one of the Sentinels he uses to see in Coldharbour at the Tower of Eyes. You can ask Lyris about many things
before moving on. Once the conversation has ended, head into the
[Bleeding Forge](/wiki/Online:The_Bleeding_Forge "流血锻炉")。

### Blinding the God of Brutality

When you enter the forge, you see [锻造大师维卡尔](/wiki/Online:Vaekar_the_Forgemaster "锻造大师维卡尔") murder a Soul Shriven. He
attacks you and Lyris next. Kill him to continue, and once you've defeated him Lyris will congratulate you on your
skills. If you are playing this quest as the tutorial, opening the character menu shows that you are now at level 2, and
you have gained a skill point. You have also gained an attribute point, which can now be used to increase either your
[生命](/wiki/Online:Health "生命"), [魔力](/wiki/Online:Magicka "魔力") or [耐力](/wiki/Online:Stamina "耐力"). The Prophet will
also comment on the battle from afar, urging you to keep moving as Molag Bal knows you've escaped. Follow the tunnel to
reach a door that leads to the [Towers of Eyes](/wiki/Online:The_Towers_of_Eyes "眼之塔")。

[![](//images.uesp.net/thumb/1/17/ON-quest-Soul_Shriven_in_Coldharbour_02.jpg)](/wiki/File:ON-quest-Soul_Shriven_in_Coldharbour_02.jpg)

[](/wiki/File:ON-quest-Soul_Shriven_in_Coldharbour_02.jpg "Enlarge")

A Coldharbour Sentinel

The Sentinels are connected, so destroying one will distract Molag Bal and keep him from seeing you. Proceed down the
stairs ahead. There's Sentinels on the hill south across the bridge and east of the stairs you just descended. Make your
way to either. Once there, Lyris will warn you not to get caught again after escaping so recently. Here, the tutorial
introduces sneaking, and you must attack the Sentinel without it seeing you by approaching it from behind. Otherwise,
simply hit it once. After you destroy the Sentinel, Lyris tells you to hurry to the Prophet's cell, the entryway being
east of the southern Sentinel hill.

As you approach the gate, it bursts into a ward of blue arcane fire, and Molag Bal himself speaks.

-
  - **莫拉格·巴尔:** _"蠢货！你永远逃不出我的手掌心！"_
  - **丽里丝·泰坦伯恩:** _"荷马莫拉之舌啊！大门被看守着，此路不通。"_

Lyris says that this route won't work, and suggests that you find another Soul Shriven named Cadwell. Cadwell is
eccentric, but knows Coldharbour better than anyone else, and might know of another way to reach the Prophet.

#### Detour

Head downstream along the river to find a small gathering of Soul Shriven by a campfire, surrounding
[卡德韦尔](/wiki/Online:Cadwell "卡德韦尔") as he plays the lute, singing a nonsensical song. Speak to him, and he'll joyfully
greet you. He directs you to a route further along the river that leads to the Undercroft, which is filled with traps
and enemies. You can ask him about a few things. When you're done, he wishes you luck and tells you to give the Prophet
his best.

Lyris warns that Cadwell probably made the route ahead sound much less dangerous than it is, and suggests caution.
She'll then proceed to run down the river, and you should follow. You'll find that the door to the Undercroft is locked.
This introduces the [开锁](/wiki/Online:Lockpicking "开锁") system, and you have 60 seconds to try to pick the lock—unlike
most other locks in the game. Once you have successfully picked it, or just forced it open, you can enter the
Undercroft.

[地下室](/wiki/Online:The_Undercroft "地下室") is lined with traps and corpses. Head forward, and a
[skeletal warrior](/wiki/Online:Skeletal_Warrior "骷髅战士") will dig its way out of the ground. Dispatch it and continue
forward, taking care to avoid the numerous flamethrower traps lining the walls. Continue to traverse your way though the
winding tunnels and pools of water until you reach a staircase leading up to the
[Prophet's Cell](/wiki/Online:The_Prophet%27s_Cell "先知的牢房")。

#### A Prophet for a Warrior

[![](//images.uesp.net/thumb/4/42/ON-place-The_Prophet%27s_Cell.jpg)](/wiki/File:ON-place-The_Prophet%27s_Cell.jpg)

[](/wiki/File:ON-place-The_Prophet%27s_Cell.jpg "Enlarge")

You'll need to free The Prophet before you can escape from Coldharbour

As soon as you enter the cell, Lyris will speak.

-
  - **丽里丝·泰坦伯恩:** _"The Prophet's cage should be just ahead. Quickly now! We haven't much time."_
  - **丽里丝·泰坦伯恩:** _"很好。好消息是，我们完好无损地到达了这里，先知看起来也没受伤。"_
  - **丽里丝·泰坦伯恩:** _"Now the bad news. It's going to be up to you to keep him safe and get him back to Tamriel. I'm not
    going with you."_

Follow her to reach a vast cavern housing a number of spiked rock formations, piles of spent
[灵魂石](/wiki/Online:Soul_Gems "灵魂石") and pools of [灵质](/wiki/Online:Azure_Plasm "灵质"). At the center of the room is a
large ritual circle, above which the Prophet hangs in a magical force-field. Speak to Lyris to find out the plan: Lyris
will swap herself with the Prophet, as the only way to remove him from the cell requires switching him out for someone
with a living soul. This naturally precludes you from sacrificing yourself. Tell her when you're ready, and she will
conclude by telling you to protect the Prophet, who will know where you need to go.

When you have finished speaking, you will need to defend Lyris from two
[Dremora Baunekyns](/wiki/Online:Dremora_Baunekyn "魔人闪电重锤"). When you defeat each one, its essence will fly off to feed
a respective Dark Pinion. The two Dark Pinions are found on the north and south sides of Lyris. Head over to each one
and disable it. Once this has been completed the exchange will begin to take place. Lyris and the Prophet are swapped,
and the Prophet collapses onto the ground where Lyris was.

- **先知:** _"自由。我记得这感觉。但要是莫拉格巴尔得逞，这种感觉就不会持久。"_

The Prophet is happy to see that you're safe. He says that once you've escaped, you'll find a way to rescue Lyris. You
can ask him some questions before he hurries you to the Anchor, a Daedric machine that binds Nirn to Coldharbour. If you
can lead him there, he can use it to get the two of you out and back to Tamriel. Head up the stairs on the other side of
the room and through the tunnel into [the Anchor Mooring](/wiki/Online:The_Anchor_Mooring "锚泊点")。

### Freedom

[![](//images.uesp.net/thumb/9/9d/ON-quest-Soul_Shriven_in_Coldharbour_05.jpg)](/wiki/File:ON-quest-Soul_Shriven_in_Coldharbour_05.jpg)

[](/wiki/File:ON-quest-Soul_Shriven_in_Coldharbour_05.jpg "Enlarge")

The Prophet calls on Akatosh to aid your escape

[![](//images.uesp.net/thumb/a/a6/ON-quest-Soul_Shriven_in_Coldharbour_03.jpg)](/wiki/File:ON-quest-Soul_Shriven_in_Coldharbour_03.jpg)

[](/wiki/File:ON-quest-Soul_Shriven_in_Coldharbour_03.jpg "Enlarge")

Escape through the Anchor Mooring

Proceed into the Anchor Mooring. Suddenly, Molag Bal appears before you.

- **莫拉格·巴尔:** _"the mortal thinks it can defy me. Futile. Soon your world will be in my chains."_

He disappears and summons the [骸骨之子](/wiki/Online:Child_of_Bones "骸骨之子"). The Prophet will run ahead and say:
_"过来，我会保护你的！"_ During battle, the bone colossus will primarily use melee attacks. There will also be one final tutorial
instructing you how to break free of a crowd-control effect. Once the colossus has been defeated, the Prophet will call
to you. Speak to him, to learn that you'll need a skyshard (Aetherial magicka carrying the essence of Nirn) to maintain
a physical body back on Nirn. He summons one, which you should interact with. Once the power has been absorbed, you will
receive a short message outlining skyshards in the tutorial. Once you have collected it, blinding light fills the room
and the Prophet begins his ritual.

- **先知:** _"Great [Akatosh](/wiki/Lore:Akatosh "Lore:Akatosh"), Dragon God of Time! I require your strength! Let the way
  be opened! Let these wandering souls return home! Let the will of Molag Bal be denied!"_

As soon as the ritual is complete, the entire anchor mooring fizzles with lightning and a large rift opens up at the
top. The Prophet yells: _"Hurry! We must go now."_ and runs forward up the staircase. As he reaches the top, the anchor
levitates him up from the ground and into the portal. Follow him, and escape to Tamriel.

### Back to Tamriel

You will be transported to one of three locations based on the faction you have joined:

- [![Aldmeri Dominion](//images.uesp.net/thumb/4/40/ON-icon-alliance-Aldmeri_%28color%29.png)](/wiki/Online:Aldmeri_Dominion "先祖神洲")
  Members of the [先祖神洲](/wiki/Online:Aldmeri_Dominion "先祖神洲") will find themselves in
  [柯娜西的居所](/wiki/Online:Khenarthi%27s_Roost "柯娜西的居所"), with the option to go to [奥瑞敦](/wiki/Online:Auridon "奥瑞敦") after
  awakening.
  \
  [![Daggerfall Covenant](//images.uesp.net/thumb/4/4f/ON-icon-alliance-Daggerfall_%28color%29.png)](/wiki/Online:Daggerfall_Covenant "匕落同盟")
  Members of the [匕落同盟](/wiki/Online:Daggerfall_Covenant "匕落同盟") will find themselves in
  [斯特罗斯·迈凯](/wiki/Online:Stros_M%27Kai "斯特罗斯·迈凯"), with the option to go to [格伦姆布拉](/wiki/Online:Glenumbra "格伦姆布拉")
  after awakening.\
  [![Ebonheart Pact](//images.uesp.net/thumb/f/f2/ON-icon-alliance-Ebonheart_%28color%29.png)](/wiki/Online:Ebonheart_Pact "黑檀心公约联合")
  Members of the [黑檀心公约联合](/wiki/Online:Ebonheart_Pact "黑檀心公约联合") will find themselves in
  [荒岩岛](/wiki/Online:Bleakrock_Isle "荒岩岛"), with the option to go to [石落](/wiki/Online:Stonefalls "石落") after awakening.

You will awaken next to a projection of the Prophet. Talk to him, and he'll tell you that the two of you have ended up
in different places. Where he will say he is depends on your faction.

- [![Aldmeri Dominion](//images.uesp.net/thumb/4/40/ON-icon-alliance-Aldmeri_%28color%29.png)](/wiki/Online:Aldmeri_Dominion "先祖神洲")
  If you are part of the Aldmeri Dominion, he will say: _"I am in a city near the sea, in a land of eternal spring. The
  air smells of the ocean, and of markets, and gardens."_
  \
  [![Daggerfall Covenant](//images.uesp.net/thumb/4/4f/ON-icon-alliance-Daggerfall_%28color%29.png)](/wiki/Online:Daggerfall_Covenant "匕落同盟")
  If you are part of the Daggerfall Covenant, he will say: _"I am in a city of industry, where men speak of intrigues
  and plots beneath layers of innuendo and pleasantry."_\
  [![Ebonheart Pact](//images.uesp.net/thumb/f/f2/ON-icon-alliance-Ebonheart_%28color%29.png)](/wiki/Online:Ebonheart_Pact "黑檀心公约联合")
  If you are part of the Ebonheart Pact, he will say: _"I am in a place with the smell of burning ash on a hot wind, and
  the sounds of a distant battle."_

Regardless of where he says he is, the Prophet will conclude that it doesn't matter and will set you on your path. You
can ask him about a few things. He doesn't know how long you were unconscious, but knows that someone picked you up and
that he's going to try to figure out how to help Lyris. The Prophet will have additional dialogue about your current
location and the first quest in the [alliance questline](#Alliance_Story), which will also vary based on the faction you
are part of. The next main quest, [避难所](/wiki/Online:The_Harborage_(quest) "The Harborage (quest)"), does not begin
straight away; rather, the Prophet will contact you through an ethereal projection when you enter a safe area, such as a
settlement.

## 成就

You will earn the following achievement for completing this quest:

## Alliance Story

After completing the quest, the Prophet will elaborate on the situation in Tamriel:

-
  - _"Be wary, vestige. Our very plane of existence is in peril. The threat of Molag Bal looms across all Tamriel, and
    chaos spreads in its shadow._

  - _Danger roams the land and will assume many forms. Do not let it catch you off-guard."_

  - **我应该去哪里？**

  - _"You must find your own path. But perhaps there is a reason for the place in which you find yourself._

  - _Explore. Search for a cause to lend your hand. Join with others. You might even seek out those who rescued you from
    the sea. The choice is yours."_

  - **你觉得有很多人需要我的帮助吗？**

    -
      - _"Indeed. I sense that even now there are good people near you who face grave danger. They need your assistance
        should you be willing to give it._
      - _To thwart the will of Molag Bal, we must skirmish with evil wherever it rears its head."_
      - **还有其他人愿意和我一起的吗？**

  - **我该和谁一起？**

    -
      - _"We do not face these troubled times alone. Many shall rise up to fight this tide of darkness._
      - _Wherever you go, you will encounter others who share your courage and valor. Help them if you can, and enlist
        their aid if you have need of it."_

Upon exiting the location you wake up in, you will meet someone who will present you with the introductory quest for
your alliance if you have not started it already.

## 笔记

- After you have completed the tutorial once, you may skip it for new characters.

  - Skipping the tutorial will cause the Soul Magic skill line to be unlocked from the start.

- Prior to Update 10, you were sent to [奥瑞敦](/wiki/Online:Auridon "奥瑞敦"), [格伦姆布拉](/wiki/Online:Glenumbra "格伦姆布拉") or
  [石落](/wiki/Online:Stonefalls "石落") at the conclusion of the tutorial, requiring you to backtrack to the "starter
  islands" in order to play the storyline quests in the intended order.

- During the [beta](/wiki/Online:Beta "Beta"), you were sent to [柯娜西的居所](/wiki/Online:Khenarthi%27s_Roost "柯娜西的居所"),
  [斯特罗斯·迈凯](/wiki/Online:Stros_M%27Kai "斯特罗斯·迈凯") or [荒岩岛](/wiki/Online:Bleakrock_Isle "荒岩岛") as you are now, but you
  were forced to complete those quests before gaining access to the mainland. This was viewed unfavorably by players and
  reviewers, resulting in the pre-Update 10 setup of being sent straight to the first main zone.

- Prior to Update 6, [厄·杰森](/wiki/Online:Er-Jaseen "厄·杰森") had a more prominent role, including being the character who
  broke you out of your prison cell.

- Prior to Update 30, this was the tutorial quest for anyone who did not own any chapters (beginning at
  [越狱](#Prison_Break)). As of Update 30, [坚石之门](/wiki/Online:The_Gates_of_Adamant "坚石之门") is the tutorial quest for all
  players.

## Quest Stages

笔记

\* Any text displayed in angle brackets (e.g., `<Alias=LocationHold>`) is dynamically set by the game and will be filled
in with the appropriate word(s) when seen in game.

- Not all Journal Entries may appear in your journal; which entries appear and which entries do not depends on the
  manner in which the quest is done.
- Stages are not always in order of progress. This is usually the case with quests that have multiple possible outcomes
  or quests where certain tasks may be done in any order. Some stages may therefore repeat objectives seen in other
  stages.
