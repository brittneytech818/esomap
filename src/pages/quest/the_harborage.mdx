## Detailed Walkthrough

[先知](/wiki/Online:The_Prophet "先知") will appear before you as soon as you enter a safe area, such as a city. Talk to him
to hear about a safe place from which you will be able able to plan how to defeat
[莫拉格·巴尔](/wiki/Online:Molag_Bal "莫拉格·巴尔"). The Prophet calls this place
"[避难所](/wiki/Online:The_Harborage_(place) "The Harborage (place)")."

### To the Harborage

For those starting in [弗克赫尔守卫](/wiki/Online:Vulkhel_Guard "弗克赫尔守卫") ([先祖神洲](/wiki/Online:Aldmeri_Dominion "先祖神洲")), the
Harborage is directly east from the docks and close to the [奥瑞敦](/wiki/Online:Auridon "奥瑞敦") coast. The Harborage is in
a seaside cave.

For those beginning in [达文卫城](/wiki/Online:Davon%27s_Watch "达文卫城") ([黑檀心公约联合](/wiki/Online:Ebonheart_Pact "黑檀心公约联合")),
the Harborage is west of the city and slightly south. If you get to [沉船浅滩](/wiki/Online:Shipwreck_Strand "沉船浅滩"), a boss
location on the coast, you've gone too far west.

If you start in [匕落](/wiki/Online:Daggerfall "匕落") ([匕落同盟](/wiki/Online:Daggerfall_Covenant "匕落同盟")), the Harborage will
be east of [巴兹加拉的马](/wiki/Online:Bazgara%27s_Horses "巴兹加拉的马"), the Daggerfall stables.

- _"Welcome to the Harborage, Vestige."_

The Prophet says you need to understand how events came to be before you can learn more about your destiny.

### Visions of the Past

- _"进入我的思想，弥留之魂，和我一起回顾过去的事件。"_

The Prophet opens a portal to a Coldharbour-like realm and walks along the path while recounting his story.

![](//images.uesp.net/thumb/0/02/ON-quest-The_Harborage_06.jpg)

[](/wiki/File:ON-quest-The_Harborage_06.jpg "Enlarge")

The Elder Scroll and the Dragonfire Brazier

- _"My part in the story began when I awoke on the steps of the Abbey of the
  [Moth Priests](/wiki/Lore:Cult_of_the_Ancestor_Moth "Lore:Cult of the Ancestor Moth"), with no memory of my past life.
  The Moth Priests took pity on me and brought me into their fold. I was weak and near death. It was there that I first
  set eyes upon the [上古卷轴](/wiki/Lore:Elder_Scrolls "Lore:Elder Scrolls"), and devoted my life to their study."_

At this point, you and the Prophet pass a brazier with an Elder Scrolls spinning above it.

- _"卷轴让我瞥见了现实的结构，但每一次深刻的洞察都会使我的视线变暗，最终永远丧失视力，再不能窥见世界的光亮。"_

He stops, and you need to talk to him again. He says your destiny is intertwined with the Five Companions, a band of
adventures who sought out the [诸王护符](/wiki/Lore:Amulet_of_Kings "Lore:Amulet of Kings") to persuade
[Akatosh](/wiki/Lore:Akatosh "Lore:Akatosh") to accept their leader as
[Dragonborn](/wiki/Lore:Dragonborn "Lore:Dragonborn"). The leader was
[瓦仁·阿基拉里奥斯](/wiki/Online:Varen_Aquilarios "瓦仁·阿基拉里奥斯"), "the son of a Colovian duke, who led a rebellion against the
[利奥维克皇帝](/wiki/Lore:Leovic "Lore:Leovic")" and crowned himself emperor.

#### Meet the Five Companions

![](//images.uesp.net/thumb/0/08/ON-quest-The_Harborage_02.jpg)

[](/wiki/File:ON-quest-The_Harborage_02.jpg "Enlarge")

The Five Companions

- _"The first Companion, [丽里丝·泰坦伯恩](/wiki/Online:Lyris_Titanborn "丽里丝·泰坦伯恩"), daughter of giants, was the greatest
  warrior in the service of the Empire. Next, [Abnur Tharn](/wiki/Online:Abnur_Tharn "Abnur Tharn"), a powerful sorcerer
  and Grand Chancellor to the [Imperial Elder Council](/wiki/Lore:Elder_Council "Lore:Elder Council"). The
  [红卫人](/wiki/Online:Redguard "红卫人") sword master [赛·萨汗](/wiki/Online:Sai_Sahan "赛·萨汗"), leader of the
  [Imperial Dragonguard](/wiki/Lore:Dragonguard "Lore:Dragonguard"). The Imperial Emperor, Varen Aquilarios, who
  attempted to light the Dragonfires and failed. And finally, [曼尼玛克](/wiki/Online:Mannimarco "曼尼玛克") the traitor. The
  King of Worms. A powerful necromancer, and your executioner."_

Talk to the Prophet again after he finishes describing each of the Five Companions. He says Mannimarco convinced Varen
that the Amulet of Kings could be used to rekindle the Dragonfires. According to Mannimarco, the Emperor could perform a
ritual that would please Akatosh enough to make him Dragonborn.

After you finish talking to the Prophet, walk back to the area where you saw the Elder Scroll earlier. The Companions
enter and begin the ritual.

#### The Soulburst

![](//images.uesp.net/thumb/6/6e/ON-quest-The_Harborage_03.jpg)

[](/wiki/File:ON-quest-The_Harborage_03.jpg "Enlarge")

Mannimarco betrays the Emperor.

-
  - **瓦仁·阿基拉里奥斯:** _"就在那里。龙火火盆。曼尼玛克，你确定这能行吗？"_
  - **曼尼玛克:** _"会成功的，我的陛下。诸王护符将重新点燃龙火，确保您名正言顺成为皇帝。我向您保证。"_
  - **丽里丝:** _"最好能成功，曼尼玛克，否则你的脖子就会被我的斧头砍断。"_
  - **Abnur:** _"陛下，我想知道您能否给您的混血巨人宠物戴上口套？她真的很烦人。"_
  - **Sai:** _"够了，你们两个！我们在这里是为了确保陛下名正言顺加冕红宝石王座。"_
  - **瓦仁·阿基拉里奥斯:** _"阿布努尔，开始仪式。我得去完成我的使命。"_

![](//images.uesp.net/thumb/5/53/ON-quest-The_Harborage_04.jpg)

[](/wiki/File:ON-quest-The_Harborage_04.jpg "Enlarge")

The Soulburst

Abnur Tharn steps up to the brazier and holds out the Amulet of Kings. Flames shoot out of the amulet, lighting the
brazier. Varen prays on the other side.

- **瓦仁·阿基拉里奥斯:** _"我将以点燃龙火宣称我的正统传承！创造之火，让我重生吧！在阿卡托什的意志下，我宣布自己是......龙裔!"_

However, Mannimarco steps forward as Varen is lifted screaming off the ground by dark magic. Mannimarco floats up above
the brazier.

-
  - **曼尼玛克:** _"瓦伦·阿基拉里奥斯，你不是阿莱西亚的继承人！你将为你的亵渎行为付出代价！泰姆瑞尔和湮灭之地的交界，裂开了！"_
  - **Abnur:** _"发生了什么？天空打开了！太糟了！非常非常糟！"_
  - **瓦仁·阿基拉里奥斯:** _"事情不应该这样的！这到底是什么意思？曼尼玛克，你做了什么？"_
  - **曼尼玛克:** _"一群傻瓜！遗忘之地和这个世界之间的交界已经被撕开了！我的主人，莫拉格巴尔可以轻易占领泰姆瑞尔了！"_
  - **瓦仁·阿基拉里奥斯:** _"阿卡托什！原谅我！请怜悯我们的灵魂吧!"_

Talk to the Prophet again, after the scene finishes.

#### Anchors from Coldharbour

![](//images.uesp.net/thumb/2/25/ON-quest-The_Harborage_05.jpg)

[](/wiki/File:ON-quest-The_Harborage_05.jpg "Enlarge")

One of Molag Bal's Dark Anchors

Follow the Prophet through the southeast arch. A Dark Anchor appears as you follow him down the path.

- _"Molag Bal's Dark Anchors pierce the torn veil, and seek to draw Nirn into the depths of Coldharbour."_

The Daedric prince's ultimate goal is to merge Nirn and Oblivion, an event known as the Planemeld. The Prophet says few
would survive it, and those that did would be enslaved for all eternity.

Talk to the Prophet again to return to the Harborage.

### The Beginning of the Story

Talk to the Prophet again in the Harborage.

You need to train and gather strength to assemble the Companions. The first one, Lyris, you met in Coldharbour. However,
the Prophet needs time to determine her exact location. He promises to contact you again "when the time is right" and
gives you a reward.

笔记

\* Any text displayed in angle brackets (e.g., `<Alias=LocationHold>`) is dynamically set by the game and will be filled
in with the appropriate word(s) when seen in game.

- Not all Journal Entries may appear in your journal; which entries appear and which entries do not depends on the
  manner in which the quest is done.
- Stages are not always in order of progress. This is usually the case with quests that have multiple possible outcomes
  or quests where certain tasks may be done in any order. Some stages may therefore repeat objectives seen in other
  stages.
